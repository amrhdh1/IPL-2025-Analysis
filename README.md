## 🎯 Project Objectives & Key Questions

Our analysis aims to answer the following specific questions:

2.  🎲 How do toss decisions impact match outcomes?
3.  📊 What are the typical scoring patterns in first and second innings?
4.  🏟️ Are there any venues that favor certain types of play or outcomes?
5.  🌟 Who were the standout individual performers (top scorers, best bowlers)?

## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights (Pivot Tables)

1.  **🎲 Toss Winner Decision Analysis**:
    * **Insight**: Explores how many matches were played at each venue and, for each venue, how often teams chose to bat or bowl after winning the toss. This reveals strategic patterns based on location.

2.  **📈 Average Scores by Stage**:
    * **Insight**: Helps understand if scoring patterns change as the tournament progresses and how different teams perform on average across various stages of the tournament.

3.  **🏆 Match Results by Toss Decision**:

4.  **🆚 Match Frequency and Outcome by Team Matchup**:
    * **Insight**: Shows how many times specific teams played against each other and highlights which team usually came out on top in those head-to-head encounters.

5.  **📉 Score Distribution and Wickets Lost (Innings Breakdown)**:
    * **Insight**: Analyzes the typical number of runs scored and wickets lost in both the first and second innings, providing context on chasing scenarios.

6.  **🏅 Player Performance Metrics (Highscore, Wickets, Runs) by Team**:
    * **Insight**: Summarizes the batting and bowling performance contributions by team, identifying consistent high-scoring or strong bowling performances across the tournament.
